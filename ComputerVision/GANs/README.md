# Training Simple Generative Adversarial Network using pytorch

* test_one.ipynb file validates if GANs actually work, lol :p, we have taken an array of certain mean and standard deviation and we'll now check if GANs can change random numbers to array of same mean and standard deviation.

* In making_num.ipynb we see how easily we can build a PyTorch model to generate handwritten number training on MNIST using unsupervised learning.
